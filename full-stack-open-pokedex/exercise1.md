In the solution of this exercise, we  will discuss the CI process on how to build, lint and test a Ruby application. In order to achieve this, we first need to use Bundler in order to create a consistent environement for the Ruby project. 
TeamCity, Bamboo, Buddy, and CircleCI can also be used  to fulfill CI in the Ruby project nsstead of using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
The decision between self-hosted and cloud-based CI environments for outt Ruby project will be based on the size and complexity of the project.
