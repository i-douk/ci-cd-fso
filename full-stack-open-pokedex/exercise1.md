In the solution of this exercise, we  will discuss the CI process on how to build, lint and test a Ruby application. In order to achieve this, we first need to use Bundler in order to create a consistent environement for the Ruby project, we will also need to create a docker instance, a linter like RuboCop and finally a tool to test our app like RSpec, these ools should be enough in order tto crceate a CI pipeline for our Ruby project.
TeamCity, Bamboo, Buddy, and CircleCI are viable aletrnatives  to fulfill CI in a Ruby project annd can be used instead of using GitHub actions and jenkins.
The decision between self-hosted CI and cloud-based CI environments for our Ruby project will be based on the size , team, and complexity of the project. Since we are working on a small scale project, it would be more productive to opt for a cloud-based CI, the pay-as-you-go possibiility offered by the  cloud is usually more cost-effective for small scale projects. There are of course downsides to choosing a cloud-based option over a self-hosted option, is that we will have less freedom in customizing options, self-hosted CI offers full control over the environement annd possibility of integration with other tools.
